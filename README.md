# NSTU-MARKET-PLACE
The "Student Classifieds" project is a web application designed to be the central marketplace for
students at the university. It addresses the inefficiency and clutter of using social media groups for
buying and selling used goods by providing a dedicated, secure, and easy-to-navigate platform.
Access will be restricted to verified students, creating a trusted community. The core features include
user authentication, categorized product listings, a "My Listings" dashboard for sellers, and a flexible,
seller-controlled communication system that leverages existing chat apps.
